# Deep Learning Midterm (No. 7)
Deep Learning Midterm (No. 7) - Indra Imanuel Gunawan / 20195118 - notMNIST CNN experiment

The experiment consists of running CNN on notMNIST dataset with different types of models, which are:
* 2 layered CNN model with Xavier initialization and ReLU activation function
* 2 layered CNN model with He initialization and ReLU activation function
* 3 layered CNN model with He initialization and ReLU activation function
* 2 layered CNN model with Xavier initialization and LeakyReLU activation function
* 2 layered CNN model with He initialization and L2 regularization

The experiment is done twice, first is running all those models with Adam Optimizer<br>
(refer to notMNIST_adam_Indra_20195118.ipynb file).<br><br>
Second is running all those models with Adagrad Optimizer<br>
(refer to notMNIST_adagrad_Indra_20195118.ipynb file).<br><br>
